### Tiny Server
Nothing to see here, just a little Express app with a dummy-simple CRUD API using Mongoskin. CORS traffic from any source is allowed to make it easy to POST/GET/PUT/DELETE JSON payloads from other apps running locally. You've been warned!

Just meant for lightweight local dev and messing around. Obviously not fit for prod :D

#### Dependencies
Run `npm install` and `bower update` to get your dependencies ready. `./node_modules` is in the `.gitignore`, Yeoman-style :)

#### Usage
Run `grunt` to fire it up, and make sure you have Mongo installed (`brew install mongo`) and that you've started the Mongo d√¶mon with `mongod`. Enjoy!
